Just a week away from Election Day in 2012, with polls showing a close race, both Presidential campaigns were forced to call off campaigning due to a massive storm headed for the east coast. In the end, Hurricane Sandy caused damage exceeding $50 Billion, making it among the largest and most costly hurricanes in the US for a century. A natural disaster of this magnitude so close to a Presidential election was unprecedented. No one could be sure what impact it would have.

After the election, my colleague Yamil Velez and I assembled data on election results and federal disaster assessments to figure out just how big a difference it made. We estimated that the effect was actually quite large: President Obama received a roughly four percentage point bump in his share of the vote in areas affected by the storm. And while it's unlikey that the hurricane tipped the scales of the election overall, it did probably influence the electoral college results in some states.

That a President would benefit from a natural disaster so close to an election isn't a foregone conclusion but there's some good reason to believe it might happen. One way of thinking about this kind of situation is that it's an opportunity to see the current President in action. If elections are a chance for voters to pay close attention and figure out whether their leader knows what he or she is doing, a large disaster response could be potentially quite revealing. This is in line with what political scientists Christopher Achens and Larry Bartels describe in a [recent book](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10671.html), as the 'folk theory' of democracy. We tend to believe that voters know pretty much what they want their leader to be like, and they know it when they see it. Voting is mostly about weighing the evidence for each candidate about who will do the best job advocating for what they want.

And leaders do get punished when things go wrong on their watch: Presidents get punished for bad economies; school boards get punished for failing test scores. But people in charge may also get blamed for things that almost certainly aren't their fault. For example, there's evidence that members of congress tend to be more likley to win their seat when their local football team is also winning. Drought, flooding, even a rough spate of shark attacks at public beaches has been linked to incumbents taking losses at the polls. In other words, while a president could get rewarded for acting decisively in a time of crisis, they may just as easily take blame from voters for events far above their pay grade.

In the specific case of Sandy, polls after the fact showed an overwhelmingly positive appraisal of the relief effort, from President Obama to the governors of New York and New Jersey and the New York City mayor. It's unlikely that the President would take a major hit for the storm, but it wasn't necessarily clear whether it would end up helping.

In order to estimate the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the election, we started with a basic assumption: storms hit some places rather than others more or less by random. Obviously coastal areas are more likely to be damaged than those far inland, but precisely where on the coast is notoriously difficult to predict. For our purposes, this means we can treat this as a natural experiment. If there's one county that receives damage and another nearby that's otherwise more or less the same but doesn't get hit, the difference in how the election turned out should tell you roughly what the impact of the hurricane was.

Of course, counties aren't all alike, and some areas really were more likely to be hit than others. We accounted for this by using a matching algorithm that took counties that were affected by the storm and found another county in the US that was a near double but was missed. We matched counties along as many metrics as we had (income, population demographics, recent election results, among others) to make the most fair comparison possible and measuring the difference in the election outcomes.

Taking into account all the areas that were affected, we found that the average impact of the storm was about 4 percentage points in the vote share between the two major party candidates, with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. Of course, though the impact we measured was fairly large, the areas that took the brunt of the storm -- Connecticut, New York and New Jersey -- were unlikely to go for Romney under any conditions. The storm was almost certainly not decisive in handing the election to President Obama. Nevertheless, it may genuinely have had an impact on the electoral college vote count.

Though some weather models predicted North Carolina was in the hurrican's path, it ended up being largely spared and narrowly won by Romney. We estimated that, in the event that all of the state's counties had been impacted in some way by the hurricane or related extreme weather patterns, the impact would have been enough to flip North Carolina for Obama.

In the case of Virginia, another key swing state, there was significantly greater damage and Obama took the state. By our estimate, if the storm had missed Virginia entirely it would likely have gone for Romney instead.
